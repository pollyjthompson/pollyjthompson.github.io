title: Judgy

---
I think I’ve learned to be judgy. It’s so ingrained it’s basically subconscious- I don’t even realise I’m doing it. I also have strong ideas about certain things/ how I would act in a certain situation/ priorities etc. that seem to feed into this when people aren’t doing what I’d do. One big thing I love about meeting new people with completely different experiences and backgrounds to me is that they do things so differently to me, draw out my judgy, then disarm it with kindness/ success. I really feel like I’m resetting this not-exactly-ideal side of me.
