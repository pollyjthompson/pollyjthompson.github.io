title: Challenges

Today was the first challenge of 7 the kids have to do over the year. We had a great talk before about winning- ‘winning is important, but not coming first. You only win against yourself.’ On first listen it sounded like the kind of meaningless rubbish ‘motivational’ speakers say but actually the more I think about it the more I like it. I embraced my previous commitment and ran some, walked some, and enjoyed it far far more looking at the views and chatting to the kids than if I had been watching my time. A personal win.

The kids also seemed to buy in, they were way more enthusiastic than expected. I’m so interested to see as the year goes on how the school use the amazing expeditions/ trips etc. So far they seem to be using them quite explicitly to teach resilience, determination, recovery from failure etc. I wonder if it’s effective? Certainly it’s something banged on about in UK schools but taught very badly, partly because it’s very hard to effectively teach in a classroom, especially with 32 disengaged kids. It’s so important but part of me wonders if you can learn it properly at school or if part of it is just part of growing up and failing along the way.
