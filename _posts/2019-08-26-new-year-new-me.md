title: New year new me

---
(The first entry into the most basic titles contest)

September is my least favourite time of year. I love summer and I hate it ending even more. My entire understanding of the word melancholy is based on how I feel at this time of year. That being said, I have always had a certain amount of anticipation for the new academic year- the new stationary, new haircut, fresh tan, fresh lot of stories. At school September was always a prime time for a mini-reinvention, and did I try. The last few years, September has been when I’ve had most time to look at the year ahead and what I want to achieve with it (probably the closest I ever get to New Year’s resolutions), and I quite enjoyed that short-lived feeling that ‘the world’s your oyster’.

But now I’m here. I’ve reached a point where I don’t desperately want to be someone else (just a better version of me, work in progress). For the first time in a long time my ambition isn’t to achieve anything in particular while I’m here, just to live, work, survive somewhere else and hopefully enjoy it. I keep expecting myself to feel lost without these two aims which seem to have governed my life for so long. But I’m not, I’m just feeling a bit excited, not even that nervous. Maybe it’s because I’ve just made a massive decision that hasn’t yet sunk in and there’s huge shock to the system coming. Going to try and enjoy it while it lasts all the same.
