My temptation with treasured memories is to try and recreate them. This is especially true of those memories that are now bittersweet, because of who they were with or what came next. I even have a tendency to want to recreate  other people’s best experiences, to do things exactly like they did and hope it leads to the same picture perfect moment.

Obviously it never works. 

But I don’t think I should stop repeating things I’ve enjoyed. I just need to make sure I’m open to something new, not just an exact repeat of last time.
