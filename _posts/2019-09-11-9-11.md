title: 9/11

I find memorial days very emotional, including 9/11. I’ve found it particularly poignant this year, having seen the memorials in real life and read about the events and impacts in more detail. Tonight I re-watched quite a lot of the live footage from the day, which I do every year. I always find that horrifying, but this year I also saw a picture of a memorial of phone call transcripts from people on the fourth hijacked plane. Their story really moved me when I first heard it. Sometimes I find the scale of the horrors of events like these somehow strips the humanity, but seeing those transcripts really brought it home. I know horrific things happen all over the world and every day, I feel guilty that I think about this one so much, probably because it happened in a rich western city I’ve had the privilege of visiting. I make sure that, like Remembrance Day is no longer just about remembering the world wars, today my thoughts are on more than just the events of one day in one place.
