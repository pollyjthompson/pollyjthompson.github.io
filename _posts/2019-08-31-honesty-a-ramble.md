title: Honesty- a ramble

More fan-fiction

I have a newfound love of being honest, and I’m trying to apply it to more and more areas of my life. It’s made me realise that I struggle to articulate a lot of my thoughts. Even when I want to be straight-up it can be hard to know exactly how I feel, or to say that in a clear way. I’m hoping blogging will help make me more articulate and in touch with my thoughts.

I’m also trying to work out what limits there are for the benefits of honesty. I think in general for me, being kind trumps being honest for honest’s sake (I do think there are occasions when ‘being cruel to be kind’ is appropriate). I find it difficult in professional settings, with people I don’t really know yet to judge how they’ll respond or what's appropriate. Despite this, I want to be brave and try to get into good habits and start establishing more honest relationships. Once I've established a relationship where I'm not very open I find it difficult to transition to being properly honest.

I think part of the reason I do sometimes feel lonely even when I’ve spent time with people is because I really haven’t been genuine. I’m probably much less of an introvert than I thought, but I find it hard to be myself with people I don’t know and trying that hard is exhausting. If I can learn to be more honest I think I would find a lot of those casual friendships a lot more fulfilling and a lot less work.
