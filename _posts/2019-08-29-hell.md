title: 'Hell '

---
My brothers find it pretty funny how wound up I get about current affairs/ hateful white men/ Greta h8rs. When I was home over summer Boris Johnson did something vaguely aggravating so I moaned about it. C, obviously trying to get a nibble, asked if I could send 10 people to hell, would Boris be one? At the time I told him I wouldn’t send anyone to hell out of spite, however tempting it might be. Nibble swerved, nice try, I win.

But maybe I’d like to revise my answer. Are there some people who’s individual net effect on the world is genuinely so terrible it’d would be worth getting them safely out of the way even if hell was the only option? If you’d make so many people’s lives so much better would it be worth living with the guilt that you’d confined someone to eternal damnation? I think Boris probably wouldn’t yet qualify as there’s unfortunately enough people that would fill his spot and do exactly the same. But Trump? Is he just a figurehead for a tide of evil that would have happened anyway? Not sure, but I think if I was to label any contemporary figure ‘evil’ it might be him.

In conclusion I’m probably going to hell.
