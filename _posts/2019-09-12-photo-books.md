Grade 8’s current cross curricula project is all about identity. As part of it they’re interviewing teachers to find out what makes up our identity. They wrote 28 questions that did a pretty good job of summarising your identity- the last one was ‘is there anything about your identity that’s important and I haven’t asked you about?’ and I couldn’t think of anything. 

The question that stumped me was ‘what’s the best present you’ve ever received?’ Not because I’ve never received a good present, but because I knew I’d been given gifts that meant so much but in that moment I could only thing of material things I really like. On my walk home I remembered. The gifts that mean more than anything to me, that have followed me round my tour of the south east of England and now Switzerland, are the photobooks two of my best friends made me for my 18th, just before we all went to uni. When I was homesick and lonely that first term at uni I used to flick through them endlessly. I hadn’t looked at them in a while until I was packing up in Colchester, and I sat there and sobbed and laughed as reread them. I sobbed and laughed all over again a few days later when my housemates presented me an updated version for my 24th. I don’t know what I did to describe such amazing friends in my life but if I ever need reminding I know exactly where to turn.
