Running downhill is the best. You have to go uphill before or after but if you take it slow and enjoy the views it’s not too bad. Plus if you run down too much it knackers your knees and your legs are dead the next day. But it’s so. Much. Fun.

That’s a metaphor for something deep for sure I just can’t be arsed to think what fits best.
