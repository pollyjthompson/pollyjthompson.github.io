title: To do lists

---
I’ve never really been a to-do-list-person, not necessarily because I was opposed to them but because I never really stuck to them or used them well. I think in the past I had less need because my to do list was essentially one or two massive things with a couple of admin points e.g. pass degree, post letters. Don’t cry at school today, pay bill. I never really found writing down the massive problem very helpful and was less likely to forget my one admin job.

But the amount of admin and work to do in the last few weeks has been a bit overwhelming. After a couple of days of forgetting all my important jobs and having mental block every time I finished a task and needed to decide what to do next, I have resorted to lists. I am addicted to ticking things off. My productivity has increased massively. My list is still most of an A4 page.
