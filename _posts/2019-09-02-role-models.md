title: Role models

---
I strongly believe that a big part of a teaching is being a role model. The problem is, I know less and less what exactly that means. On the surface, I would have said it means someone to look up to, to learn from, and to model your behaviour and aspirations on. But what does that actually look like?

In my old job I worried that I was so alien to the kids that they couldn’t relate to me at all, and so I wasn’t really a role model. Do our role models have to be like us? I don’t think so, but it’s a lot harder to model yourself off someone who’s has completely different opportunities and experiences to you.

I also struggle to think which of my teachers I would say were role models to me. I admired and respected a lot of them, but I can’t remember looking at any of them and thinking I wanted to be like them.

So I think maybe teachers’ positions as role models are more subtle. By providing a stable adult role you can model many positive behaviours/ attitudes that perhaps influence them more than they or you realise. You demonstrate a normal that they then gradually absorb, and so if you do it mindful you can gently introduce all sorts of things. I have thought about this a lot in the context of teaching kids how to talk about and deal with their emotions. I have observed some teachers do it really effectively, building a positive culture and habits in the kids. It’s probably a much more effective method than lectures that ‘it’s ok not to be ok’ etc. I want to consciously try to be more of that kind of role model this year.

I have also been thinking more about my current role models. There are lots of people that I admire, that I try to be more like, or who’s careers and lives I try to emulate. At my summer internship I heard a lot of people talk about the importance of mentors in their careers. As a trainee teacher you have a mentor, and I’m missing having that role now I’m qualified. It seems an awkward thing to do, to ask someone to mentor you, especially if you don’t have a specific end goal in mind. But I am determined to get better at expressing my ambitions and working actively to achieve them, so maybe that would be a good early step. Hopefully there’ll be a part II sometime soon.
