title: 'Priorities '

---
I’m really bad at committing to things- I’m a very short term person. This blog was stared in the hope it would help my commitment to journaling. Today I made last minute plans to go out after work and it genuinely caused me a fair amount of angst that I didn’t have a blog plan. But then I tried to prioritise. This is important to me but making friends and a new life here is more important. I’m glad I’m still drunk blogging (albeit after 12) but it’s not my priority and I’m ok with that. I hope I can vary the this on but I can’t and shouldn’t prioritise it over things that will make me more happy in The long run. Typing drunk is hard.
