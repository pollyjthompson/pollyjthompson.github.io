title: Coconut milk

---
Moving somewhere new is exhausting. So much admin. So much investment into making friends. So much effort to learn your way around, how things are done, your new routine. One thing that always stresses me is learning a new supermarket. Where are the toilet rolls? Is the tofu with the cheese or the meat? Why do they sell hard boiled eggs in shells that have been dyed different colours??? It took me 4 trips to find the coconut milk (next to the tins of soup obviously) and it was extortionate. I almost changed my whole dinner plan but I’m so glad I didn’t because this coconut milk is the shit. Best curry I’ve ever made, especially when eaten for breakfast when hungover.

I guess it’s just a nice reminder to myself that change isn’t always bad.
