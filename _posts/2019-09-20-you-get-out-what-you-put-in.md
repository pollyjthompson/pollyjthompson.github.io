title: You get out what you put in

Maybe to closest I ever get to a genuine motto/ mantra/ ethos/ cheesy line to make you seem deep.

I think we all have a tendency to try and be chill and aloof. Teenagers seems to see it as a sign of weakness and deep uncoolness to show any sign of enthusiasm. Having come to terms with the fact that I never have been and never will be cool, I would rather look a bit lame but have fun. Participating and trying sets you up for failure and embarrassment, but also for meeting the most fun and interesting people, for new experiences and learning shit. It’s really easy for people to tell you to ‘throw yourself in’ but much harder to bring yourself to do it. Once I started it’s become easier each time. I think it’s one of the most important things I’ve learn as an adult.
