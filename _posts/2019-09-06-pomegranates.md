Literally the most beautiful fruit ever. They look like actual jewels. Every food looks better with pomegranate on. And they taste delicious. And it’s satisfyingly messy  to prepare but not in a gross way like cutting chicken or frying fish. But enough of an effort to stop it being everyday so it’s always a treat. People who buy prepares should get in the sea with all that plastic they’ve made.

10/10 fruit I feel very strongly about this
