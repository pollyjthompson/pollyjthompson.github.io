We all, I think, have a tendency to ignore the small positives and let the little negatives really drag us down. I do. With the bigs things thus far I have been incredibly lucky, and I do make an effort to stay grateful for that. Now I’m also learning to notice and appreciate the little things that make me happy too. It’s easier when the balance is on the side of happy. But hopefully it’s a habit that will last even on shit days.
