title: Comfort zone

---
Today we had fire training. It was wild. First of all we watched a scene from the US office and then we set shit on fire and squirted fire extinguishers at it. Science teacher’s dream.

That’s obviously a selective telling of events- we actually had in an organisation in that provide safe simulations to practice using extinguishers, fire blankets etc. Plus in reality I’m pretty nervous around fire. My cousin died in a house fire when I was younger, and our neighbours’ house burned down when I was about 10, which gave me wake-up-in-the-night-sobbing nightmares for months. Today’s activity culminated in putting out a chip pan fire with a blanket- turns out you can’t throw from afar and you have to get pretty up close and personal with the flames.

Conquering the fear was worth it, both because I would be far better placed to help in an emergency and because the adrenaline rush/ I did it afterglow is great. With so much recently I’ve realised how much less terrifying something is once you’ve done it once, that mental hurdle is by far the worst bit. I’m increasingly trying to put myself out my comfort zone so I make myself do these new things and become more confident. I think moving abroad was as much ‘for the sake of it’ as for the pleasure of living somewhere this amazing.

But where does it stop? I’m the worst for FOMO and just wanting a bit more- if they can do it why can’t I? But at the same time I’m lazy AF and a bit of an introvert. At what point do I recognise that actually I’ve done some awesome thigs and it’s time to just enjoy my comfort zone that I’ve worked so hard to build? Or how do I know when to keep pushing and enjoying the rewards?
