title: 'Learning French '

---
One big attraction of living here specifically was to improve my French. Of all foreign languages French is the one I am least terrible at/ have the most prior exposure too, so it seemed most realistic that I might get up to a decent level by living somewhere French speaking. I hate that I am so anglicised that I can’t really communicate except in English. It seems to reflect the very worst of our culture in Britain- arrogant, lazy, inward facing. I’ve already faced several situations where my lack of French has been embarrassing and jarring, but at the same time the fact I speak English at work all day every day means I feel like I’m not making much progress. Hopefully I’m starting lessons soon which might be a bit more effective than duo but I’m full of fear that I’ll leave here with barely more French and a feeling that I wasted an opportunity. I don’t really know what to do about it. Is making it a priority and actively looking out for opportunities to improve enough for now? Write back future me.
