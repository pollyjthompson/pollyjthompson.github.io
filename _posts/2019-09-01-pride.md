title: Pride

Today I have very sore legs and yesterday I had a stinker of a hangover- both because I was trying to keep up with the boys. I think I do it because I’m too proud to admit ‘weakness’, I hate being looked after and I hate being patronised. Near the top of our walk today I had to admit defeat and have a sit down. My excuse is I hadn’t had lunch but really I don’t know why I expect myself to keep up with much taller, much fitter guys. Honestly it was fine, they seemed happy to enjoy the view while I had a drink and the only person who made jokes about it on the way down was me. Even if they had ribbed me why should I care? This pride is one of my least favourite things about myself but I don’t really know how to go about changing it. Maybe by being honest I’ll get more used to being vulnerable and gradually it’ll fade.
