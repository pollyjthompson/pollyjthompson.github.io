title: 'Clothes shopping '

---
For a myriad of ethical reasons I’ve been trying to cut down on the amount of clothes shopping I do. Today I ordered some basics off ASOS because I gave away most of my work wardrobe when I moved. Plus I added some shoes because I love them and it’s just about justifiable for practical reasons. I don’t know where the balance is. I’m trying to decide if I should never shop at these places again, or if the lack of local charity shops and the fact I have to be presentable for work/ I like clothes is a good enough reason for a small amount of shopping here and there. Am I just making excuses and copping out? I can be and will try to be better but it’s unrealistic to say I will never shop online again. I should do more research into better alternatives though.
