I am a self-diagnosed podcast addict, or ‘pod-cat’ to quote Dolly Alderton. Especially now I live alone, I listen to a shocking amount. Having said a couple of weeks ago, somewhat jokingly, that it was because I don’t like to be left alone with my thoughts, it was funny to here Dolly discuss the exact same thing on the High-Low. Maybe there is some truth in it. I also totally agreed with their point about it being such a symptom of our chronically busy, multitasking lives. We always need to being doing at least 2 things at once, and podcasts are perfect for that. Maybe this sounds negative and it’s not, because I genuinely love podcasts. The only downside I can see is that I listen to less music than I once did. One ear each?
