title: Being selfish

---
This is my selfish year, and I’m loving it. Yet I can’t kick the side order of guilt. When I say selfish, I don’t completely mean it in the worst sense of ‘fuck everyone else, I’m doing this for my personal gain at their else’s expense’. I guess there is a small part of that, but mostly I just mean I am making decisions based on what I think will make me happiest in the short to medium term. Hopefully I’m not hurting anyone in the process, that’s certainly not the intention, but I think there is an inevitable side effect of not contributing as positively to some people’s lives as perhaps I could if I was acting in other motivations. The guilt can’t change that, so it feels like a pointless emotion. I suppose it’s good to ty channel it as a reminder that I don’t want selfishness to be my main motivator for very long, so I might as well enjoy this to the very full while it lasts.
