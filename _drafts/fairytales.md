title: Fairytales

Beauty and the beast was on the tv today and it was a surprisingly enjoyable way to spend a post-trip post-run afternoon. It’s been so long since I’ve watched it I’d forgotten the storyline, and as much as I can’t help but critique the gender roles in fairytales (quelle surprise) I am still as big a fan as ever of happy endings. For me a predictable, feel good kids film is the best kind of escapism when you need to switch off from a mad week.
