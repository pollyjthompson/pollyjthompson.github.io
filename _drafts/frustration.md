title: Frustration

---
When people tell me they disagree with my perspective or actions I find it really hard to deal with constructively. I automatically go on the defensive and I think I sometimes dig in even deeper. It’s something I’m really trying to be better at. It also makes me unsure how to tell someone that their words or actions frustrate me without pushing them away or upsetting them. I think to an extent it’s useful to learn to let little things slide. But it’s important to learn to express yourself, including when it means telling other people some hard truths about how they make you feel or that you disagree with them about something important. It seems to come out inevitably anyway, so I need to learn to say it constructively at the right time. Where’s the line between passion/ conviction and ranting/ lecturing? TBD.
