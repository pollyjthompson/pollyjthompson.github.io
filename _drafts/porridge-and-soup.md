title: Porridge and soup

---
I made butternut soup for dinner, one of my absolute favourites. By the end of winter I am souped out and need a summer of recovery, but this time of year there is nothing more comforting and delicious than rediscovering all my favourite soup recipes. The same goes for porridge in the morning- I look forward to it every morning in September and dread it by February.

In the past my hatred of autumn (because it meant the end of summer) clouded by enjoyment of everything that came with it. Even picking blackberries and making crumble (one of my all time favourite activities full stop) is clouded in a feeling of melancholy. 

For some reason this year, I think because I’m excited rather than depressed about this year starting, I haven’t felt that. I’ve enjoyed all these little moments that mark autumn coming. I need to be more conscious of making sure I can do that in every area of my life- the little things add up very quickly.
