How do you deal with people who make no effort to be accommodating or easy-going? I’m not used to people who are so happy to make things awkward. I do really respect people who openly express what they want and go and get it, and people who stand by what they think. But I also think there’s a lot to be said for picking your moments, and trying to make people around you more comfortable and their lives easier. Maybe I need to adjust to it by standing my ground more too, but it’s hard to try to learn to essentially escalate conflict in one situation while doing the absolute opposite at work every day.
