title: Arrival fallacy

---
I’ve had a few conversations recently about goal-setting and shifting goal posts. For me, I need to always be working towards something, to feel like I’m going somewhere. I don’t mind the fact that my goal posts shift so I never reach them because the fear of not going anywhere worthwhile is way worse than the feeling that you never reach your goal. I’ve been wondering a lot why I feel so strongly like that when for other people it’s such a source of frustration.

So I was particularly interested by something I listened to today about arrival fallacy- working towards that one thing that you subconsciously feel will make you happy forever, only to achieve it and realise your life is still far from perfect. I think the reason I don’t mind not reaching my goals before they shift is that I don’t feel that way about them any more (I do vividly remember being 13 and waiting for the moment I got hot and my life became great). I have a few ideas why (and it’s not because I’m in any way superior to people who do) but I don’t think they really explain it all. Maybe I’m just a bit less ambitious, my goals are too small scale to feasibly perfect my life. I think also I’ve met a lot of people in my life who are on paper extremely successful yet are still far from perfectly happy, and that has seeped into my consciousness.

I do intend to do some thinking about my ambitions and goals. At the moment though I’m quite enjoying ticking my list off one by one (currently- living abroad) rather than tackling them all at once which seems difficult and scary. Conveniently, this seems to be doing a pretty good job at helping me towards my most goal that goes against all of what I said above but I know I’ll never perfectly achieve- be happy.
